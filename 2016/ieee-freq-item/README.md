Comparing Dataset Characteristics that Favor the Apriori, Eclat or FP-Growth Frequent Itemset Mining Algorithms
Jeff Heaton

Abstract: Frequent itemset mining is a popular data mining technique.  Apriori, Eclat, and FP-Growth 
are among the most common algorithms for frequent itemset mining.  This paper explores the 
effects that several dataset characteristics can have on the performance of these three frequent 
itemset algorithms.  To perform this empirical analysis, a dataset generator is created to measure 
the effects of frequent item density and the maximum transaction size on performance.  While other 
papers have examined the performance of these algorithms against each other, this paper seeks 
to explore the effects of the data on performance across algorithms. This provides some insight 
into dataset characteristics conducive to each algorithm.
